To perform this program in Eclipse, you'll need to follow similar steps as before to set up a dynamic web project and create the necessary HTML and JSP files. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Set up a Dynamic Web Project

1. Open Eclipse IDE.
2. Go to `File` > `New` > `Dynamic Web Project`.
3. Enter a project name (e.g., `FibonacciSequence`) and click `Next`.
4. Choose the target runtime (e.g., Apache Tomcat) and click `Next`.
5. Click `Finish` to create the project.

### Step 2: Create HTML and JSP Files

1. Right-click on the `WebContent` folder in your project.
2. Go to `New` > `File`.
3. Enter `FiboNo.html` as the file name and click `Finish`.
4. Paste the provided HTML content into `FiboNo.html`.
5. Right-click on the `WebContent` folder again.
6. Go to `New` > `File`.
7. Enter `Fibo.jsp` as the file name and click `Finish`.
8. Paste the provided JSP code into `Fibo.jsp`.

### Step 3: Run the Project

1. Right-click on your project.
2. Go to `Run As` > `Run on Server`.
3. Choose your configured server (e.g., Apache Tomcat) and click `Finish`.

Eclipse will start the server and deploy your web application. Once the server is started, you can access the HTML form by navigating to the appropriate URL in a web browser. For example:

```
http://localhost:8080/FibonacciSequence/FiboNo.html
```

Replace `localhost:8080` with the appropriate hostname and port of your servlet container.

### Observing the Fibonacci Sequence

After entering a number in the HTML form and clicking "submit," the JSP page (`Fibo.jsp`) will display the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number.
